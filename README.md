# NEAT-2048

This program trains an ML model to play to game 2048 using the Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm. 2048.py creates the game 2048 from scratch, which allows the user to play 2048 and compare to the ML model. 2048_Graphicless.py trains the ML model, and Display_Model.py allows the user to choose any stage of the trained model and watch it perform in a live game. An example training is shown in Example_NEAT.zip.
